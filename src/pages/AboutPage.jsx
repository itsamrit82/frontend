            <p className="story-intro">
              There was a time when we walked store after store, browsed brand after brand â€” searching not just for fashion, but for something <em>different</em>.
            </p>
            
            <div className="story-highlight">
              <p>And that's where it began.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              The AellÃ¨ was born from <strong>frustration and fire</strong> â€” the kind that builds when you know women deserve more than what's offered. We knew there was a gap â€” <em>a missing voice</em> in Indian fashion that celebrates <strong>uniqueness</strong> with grace.
            </p>

            <p>
              So, we took a bold step. With zero experience in fashion but hearts full of purpose, we started crafting designs that <strong>felt like statements</strong> â€” not just outfits.

            <p>
              The AellÃ¨ is not just a clothing label â€” it is a movement. A space where <strong>modern western silhouettes meet soft Indian femininity</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started this journey for every woman who, like us, looked everywhere and didn't find <em>herself</em>. Now, she doesn't have to look anymore.
